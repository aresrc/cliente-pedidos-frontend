- Background color: Soft beige (#F2E7D8) to create a welcoming and neutral backdrop that enhances the readability of the menu.
- Accent color: Deep brown (#8C6349), an analogous color, used for interactive elements, emphasizing a natural and comforting tone that subtly complements the main gold theme.
- Clean and legible font for menu descriptions and prices.
- Simple, consistent icons for menu categories (e.g., appetizers, entrees, desserts).
- Clear visual hierarchy with distinct sections for menu, order summary, and QR code.
- Subtle animations when adding items to the order or generating the QR code.
